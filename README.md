## Room Words Sample

This repository contains the finished sample code for the Architecture Components codelab in Kotlin for the Architecture Components Kotlin codelab on the kotlin branch.

## Pre-requisites

- Android Studio 3.0 or later and you know how to use it.

- Make sure Android Studio is updated, as well as your SDK and Gradle. Otherwise, you may have to wait for a while until all the updates are done.

- A device or emulator that runs SDK level 20

You need to be solidly familiar with the Java programming language, object-oriented design concepts, and Android Development Fundamentals. In particular:

- RecyclerView and Adapters
- SQLite database and the SQLite query language
- Threading and ExecutorService
- It helps to be familiar with software architectural patterns that separate data from the user interface, such as MVP or MVC. This codelab implements the architecture defined in the Guide to App Architecture

## Getting Started

1. Install Android Studio, if you don't already have it.
2. Download the sample.
3. Import the sample into Android Studio.
4. Build and run the sample.
